MIP Models for Flow Shop Scheduling with Inter-stage Flexibility and Blocking Constraints. In: Bruglieri, M., Festa, P., Macrina, G., Pisacane, O. (eds) Optimization in Green Sustainability and Ecological Transition. ODS 2023. AIRO Springer Series, vol 12. Springer, Cham. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-47686-0_4</a>.

In this repository they are tested 4 MIP models for the flow shop scheduling with inter-stage flexibility and blocking constraints.

The MIP problem are solved by using <a href="https://www.gurobi.com/">Gurobi</a>. An active licence to Gurobi is needed in order to run the experiments.
