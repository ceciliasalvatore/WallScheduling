# WallScheduling

In this repository they are tested 4 MIP models for the flow shop scheduling with inter-stage flexibility and blocking constraints.

The MIP problem are solved by using <a href="https://www.gurobi.com/">Gurobi</a>. An active licence to Gurobi is needed in order to run the experiments.
